    <div class="about-me-desc">
      <p>With a background in science and a passion for problem-solving, I stumbled into the world of programming and discovered a whole new realm of possibilities. After years of hard work and dedication, I am proud to call myself a successful engineer with experience engineering products for prestigious clients such as RRDonelly, LSC Communications, and GE Healthcare.</p>
      <p>Working with people from all over the world has been an incredibly rewarding experience, allowing me to expand my knowledge and expertise in this ever-evolving field. I take great pride in my work, always striving to code websites with the utmost respect for standards and best practices. In fact, I even used to validate my site - a true testament to my attention to detail and commitment to quality.</p>
      <p>Currently based in Coimbatore, I am employed by Accenture India and regularly travel to client locations to work closely with teams and deliver exceptional results. Whether in my own backyard or on the other side of the globe, I approach each project with the same level of enthusiasm and dedication.</p>
      <p>As an engineer, I am constantly learning and growing, always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to push the boundaries of what is possible. With a passion for innovation and a drive to succeed, I am excited to see where this journey will take me next.</p>
