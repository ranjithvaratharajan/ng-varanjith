    <div class="about-me-desc">
      <p>With a background in science and a passion for problem-solving, I stumbled into the world of programming and
      discovered a whole new realm of possibilities. After years of hard work and dedication, I am proud to call myself
      a successful engineer with experience engineering products for prestigious clients such as RRDonelly, LSC
      Communications, and GE Healthcare.</p>

      <p>Working with people from all over the world has been an incredibly rewarding experience, allowing me to expand my
      knowledge and expertise in this ever-evolving field. I take great pride in my work, always striving to code
      websites with the utmost respect for standards and best practices. In fact, I even used to validate my site - a
      true testament to my attention to detail and commitment to quality.</p>

      <p>Currently based in Coimbatore, I am employed by Accenture India and regularly travel to client locations to work
      closely with teams and deliver exceptional results. Whether in my own backyard or on the other side of the globe,
      I approach each project with the same level of enthusiasm and dedication.</p>

      <p>As an engineer, I am constantly learning and growing, always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to push
      the boundaries of what is possible. With a passion for innovation and a drive to succeed, I am excited to see
      where this journey will take me next.</p>

          <h4>UI / UX Developer</h4>
          <p>In the ever-evolving digital landscape, a captivating user interface (UI) and seamless user experience (UX)
            are paramount. As a UI/UX developer, I specialize in crafting visually appealing, intuitive websites that
            leave a lasting impression. Leveraging the latest versions of Angular and React, I ensure that your website
            not only looks cutting-edge but also functions flawlessly.</p>

          <h4>Backend Developer</h4>
          <p>Behind every great frontend, there's a robust backend, and I've got that covered. With extensive experience
            in backend technologies such as C#, SQL Server, SSIS, and SSRS, I build the strong foundation your
            application needs to thrive. From data management to server-side logic, I handle it all, ensuring your
            application runs seamlessly and securely</p>

          <h4>TTD & SOLID</h4>
          <p>Coding isn't just about writing lines of code; it's about crafting reliable, maintainable, and scalable
            solutions. That's why I'm committed to TTD and adhere to organizational coding standards rigorously. Every
            line of code I write is backed by tests, guaranteeing its correctness and performance. I follow the SOLID
            principles to create code that's not just functional but also elegant and easy to maintain.</p>

          <h4>Problem Solver</h4>
          <p>Challenges are opportunities in disguise, and I thrive on solving them. Whether it's a technical roadblock
            or a complex puzzle, I'm here to find solutions that make a difference. Recently, I had the honor of winning
            a hackathon at GE Healthcare by tackling their most dreaded iframe problems head-on. If you have a problem,
            consider it half-solved when you reach out to me</p>
